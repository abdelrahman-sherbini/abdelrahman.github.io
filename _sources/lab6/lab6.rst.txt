Practical Malware Analysis - Lab 6
==================================
The goal of the labs for this chapter is to help you to understand the overall
functionality of a program by analyzing code constructs. Each lab will guide
you through discovering and analyzing a new code construct. Each lab builds
on the previous one, thus creating a single, complicated piece of malware
with four constructs. Once you’ve finished working through the labs, you
should be able to more easily recognize these individual constructs when you
encounter them in malware.

Lab 6-1
-------
In this lab, you will analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-01.exe.

**Q1: What is the major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main?**

In the main function we see a JNZ after compare instruction so it's most likely if construct 

.. image:: q1.png

There a function called before, it checks Internet connection and prints the state with if condition (cmp + JZ) based on output 

.. image:: q11.png

Then string is pushed as a parameter to a subroutine for the next question

**Q2: What is the subroutine located at 0x40105F?**

Going into the subroutine it is most likely doing string operations into I/O stream

.. image:: q2.png

**Q3: What is the purpose of this program?**

Checking the Internet connection and printing to the output if there is a connected success or fail

running the file

Lab 6-2
-------
Analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-02.exe.

**Q1: What operation does the first subroutine called by main perform?**

It returns 1 if there is Internet connection and prints success

.. image:: q21.png

**Q2: What is the subroutine located at 0x40117F?**

A string argument is passed before calling that routine (same string format passed to printf)

.. image:: q22.png

Same as Q2 in Lab 6-1

**Q3: What does the second subroutine called by main do?**

Here it tries to openurl practicalmalwareanalysis.com with internet explorer v7.5 agent and depending if success  jumps to location to continue or prints fail and returns 

.. image:: q23.png

If success it calls internetreadfile to try to read 200 bytes of the url and if fails, it prints failed to readfile and returns 

.. image:: q231.png

If success it compares first bye with 0x3C ("<" in ASCII) and other conditions (when combined <!--)

.. image:: q232.png

If it fails any condition it prints failed to receive command and returns

.. image:: q234.png




**Q4: What type of code construct is used in this subroutine?**

It is a bunch of if conditions then switch case 

.. image:: q232.png

**Q5: Are there any network-based indicators for this program?**

Yes User agent and Url

.. image:: q3.png

**Q6: What is the purpose of this malware?**

As a summary it will check internet connection then openurl to the url pma/cc.htm and check if it starts with <!-- then outputs ``success parsed command``
then sleeps for 6 seconds

Lab 6-3
-------
In this lab, we’ll analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-03.exe.

**Q1: Compare the calls in main to Lab 6-2 ’s main method. What is the new function called from main?**

**Q2: What parameters does this new function take?**

**Q3: What major code construct does this function contain?**

**Q4: What can this function do?**

**Q5: Are there any host-based indicators for this malware?**

**Q6: What is the purpose of this malware?**


Lab 6-4
-------
In this lab, we’ll analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-04.exe.

**Q1: What is the difference between the calls made from the main method in Labs 6-3 and 6-4?**

**Q2: What new code construct has been added to main?**

**Q3: What is the difference between this lab ’s parse HTML function and those of the previous labs?**

**Q4: How long will this program run? (Assume that it is connected to the Internet.)**

**Q5: Are there any new network-based indicators for this malware?**

**Q6: What is the purpose of this malware?**
