Blackcat Ransomware 
===================================

Using PEID, it is using CRC32 a checksome algorithm and crpytographic library

.. image:: Screenshot_2.png

the libraries the malware needed in rust

.. image:: Screenshot_39.png

It requires a key to run

.. image:: Screenshot_3.png

in x32dbg, noticed accesstoken is passed to this function and the program closes if i step over it

.. image:: Screenshot_23.png

which in IDA psuedo code looks like this

.. image:: Screenshot_24.png

It has TLS functions 

.. image:: Screenshot_4.png

Going into first TLS callback, it uses TlsGetValue with TlsIndex set to global variable

.. image:: Screenshot_5.png

Finding the TlsAlloc import where it is called as it has to be called to set TlsIndex first ,not in TLS callback
but passing all TLS callbacks in x32 i get to the entrypoint, and nothing happens on the VM

will reverse backwards a bit to make easier starting with our CryptGenRandom found in PEID (that generates a random number)
One of places it is called under LABEL 8, here it gets the rand number and just returns 

.. image:: Screenshot_8.png

and that is called depending on value from TLS

.. image:: Screenshot_9.png

then naming the caller of all above to Rand and going to where it is called, we notice the use of SSE instructions for vectorized processing (used in acceleration)
the encryption used based on this maybe AES also since it uses _mm_loadu_si128 maybe it outputs 128-bit result

.. image:: Screenshot_10.png

naming above function Encrypt_SSE, looking where it is called we see some more encryption related stuff

.. image:: Screenshot_11.png

the function is called within more encryption stuff then all is called with some passed as parameters maybe the block that will be encrypted

.. image:: Screenshot_12.png

.. image:: Screenshot_13.png

Let's check other commonly used function by Ransomware like Reg*, findnextfile, findNextVolume createToolSnapShot, Getsysteminfo , SystemParameters , ControlService , and SC manager and others for networking and system
First ControlService used in this function

.. image:: Screenshot_14.png

Notice it is recursive function

.. image:: Screenshot_15.png

with enumerating depending services passed to the caller (a1) and then processing information about the services

.. image:: Screenshot_16.png

.. image:: Screenshot_17.png

Then uses the mentinoned above ControlService which Sends a control code to a service. with passed second parameter the code is 1 which is stop
So it is stopping all depending services 

.. image:: Screenshot_19.png

.. image:: Screenshot_20.png

Then retrieves the current status of the specified services based on the specified information level then returns 1 if all is well 

.. image:: Screenshot_18.png

stepping out of the function, we see it opens the service control manager with all rights whose handle is passed into services_enumed function

.. image:: Screenshot_22.png

.. image:: Screenshot_21.png

It uses openprocesstoken and NTopenProcessToken to do some functions with higherprivilege (if it was started in higher privilege which makes me think there is a privilege escalation)

.. image:: Screenshot_31.png

.. image:: Screenshot_32.png

It also uses FindFirstVolume and findNextVolume loops through all the volume most likely for encryption

.. image:: Screenshot_33.png

.. image:: Screenshot_34.png

We notice it is also using NetShareSum and used for SMB like services and encryptes the shared files as well

.. image:: Screenshot_35.png

It grabs my system information like number of processors and architecture likely for antiVM

.. image:: Screenshot_36.png

It changes the wallpaper by accessing SystemParametersInfo function with parameter 14
Then finally it creates the ransome note using WriteFile
